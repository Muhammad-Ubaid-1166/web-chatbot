🤖 AI Chatbot with Admin Panel built using FastAPI, React, and Docker where users chat with an AI agent, unanswered questions are automatically routed to an Admin Panel, admins reply manually, and responses are delivered back to users via polling; Backend uses FastAPI + Uvicorn + Python with REST endpoints (/chat, /admin_toggle, /user_data, /admin_message), Frontend uses React + Axios + React Router with separate User Chat and Admin Panel views, environment variables are managed via .env (OPENAI_API_KEY, HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY), backend is fully Dockerized with Dockerfile and docker-compose, supports Hugging Face Spaces deployment (port 7860), includes caching, conversation memory, admin mode toggle, automatic polling, CORS enabled, and is designed for easy local development, Docker deployment, and production hosting. 
Note: Although this project could not fully meet all the requirements, I put in my best effort to implement the core functionality and deliver a working solution within the given time and constraints.
